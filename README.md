# 🧠 Customer Churn Detection

A machine learning project to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a company (churn) based on historical data and behavioral patterns.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical problem in many industries. Retaining existing customers is much more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses supervised machine learning to predict churn and help businesses take proactive actions.
